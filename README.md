A generalized Mod Loader for GDScript-based Godot games.  
The Mod Loader allows users to create mods for games and distribute them as zips.  
Importantly, it provides methods to change existing scripts, scenes, and resources without modifying and distributing vanilla game files.

## Getting Started

You can find detailed documentation, for game and mod developers, on the [Wiki](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/wiki/) page.

## Godot Version
The current version of the Mod Loader is developed for Godot 3.5. The Godot 4 version is in progress on the [4.x branch](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/tree/4.x), but it is currently hindered by an engine bug. We are hopeful that this issue will be resolved with the release of Godot 4.3.
